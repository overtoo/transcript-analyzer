  "正體中文\n首先，一開始我想要跟大家說一個活動，那就是我的podcast節目，這個節目已經快要滿一年了。天啊。我從去年2020年8月19號，我上傳了第一集的節目，然後到現在已經快要一年了。真的很不可思議。一年說長不長，說短不短，讓我覺得哇蠻感動的。所以我想要來辦一個Q&A，如果你有任何的問題，不管是關於我的問題或是關於台灣的問題，你都可以問我。那你可以到我的ig我的ID是talktaiwanesemandarinpodcast。或是在我的youtube頻道。找到這個影片，然後在下面留言問我問題，或是你可以在我的Patreon上面直接傳訊息給我，或是在這一集的post下面留言問我問題，都可以。\n那到時候我會錄一集特別節目，特別來回答大家的問題。所以對我有任何的問題都可以趁現在問我。\n那第二個小小的活動呢，是我想要送明信片。我可能會隨便選兩位聽眾。那要怎麼得到這個明信片呢？我做的明信片哦，我現在還沒有做，但是等到這個活動開始了之後我就會來做，我可能會選我在台灣旅行的時候自己拍的照片，然後把它做成明信片，親手寫明信片給你。那要怎麼得到這個明信片呢？你可以在show note節目資訊欄找到活動的方法，來參加這個活動，不管你在哪裡，不管你在國外，或是世界任何一個地方，我都會寄給你。所以如果你想得到我親手做的，親手寫的明信片的話，就可以去看一下活動辦法要怎麼得到哦。\n02:40\n好，那我們就開始今天的節目吧。今天我要跟大家聊的話題是，這是一位聽眾朋友在我的ig告訴我說他想要聽我聊的主題，就是：台灣的日常習慣但在澳洲看了很奇怪。這個話題還蠻有意思的，所以我就想了一下。如果是比較新的聽眾朋友可能不知道，我之前在2018年到2020年初的時候，有在澳洲的墨爾本住了一年多。所以今天都是我自己的經驗，那因為我都是住在墨爾本。也許每個地方，每個城市，每個州有一點不一樣吧。不過我就是以我住在墨爾本的經驗來跟大家分享。\n第一個就是說，在台灣其實蠻多人，特別是女生，蠻多人會撐傘，我說的是天氣好的時候，大太陽的時候會撐傘。就是陽傘，拿來遮太陽，所以這個在台灣是很普遍的事情。\n03:54\n可能有很多原因，第一個可能就是不想要曬傷，或是不想要得皮膚癌，或是不想要曬黑。那我自己其實我也會撐傘，那我是不怕曬黑，我覺得沒差。但是因為我的臉很敏感，我的臉是曬到太陽就會變得很泛紅，然後我之前都有在看皮膚科醫生。他就建議我不要曬太陽，要防曬，戴帽子啊或撐傘什麼的。那因為我不太喜歡擦防曬在我的臉上。我就覺得很麻煩又沒有很舒服，所以我都是用物理性防曬，什麼是物理性防曬？就是我會戴帽子或是撐傘，那是因為我的臉沒有辦法曬太陽，其他的部位就比較沒差。\n04:48\n在澳洲的時候，我幾乎沒有看過有人在天氣好的時候會撐傘，就是只有下雨的時候才會撐傘。可是澳洲夏天的時候真的也是超熱，我在墨爾本的時候最熱有到40度。我真的嚇到，沒想到會怎麼熱。因為我覺得台灣也很熱，但是我從來沒有遇過40度的高溫。然後在那個時候，我就覺得好熱啊，天哪，好想要撐傘啊。可是都沒有人撐傘，我就覺得不好意思撐，就不想要被覺得這個人很奇怪。所以我在那邊待了一年多，我印象中只有看過兩次有人撐陽傘，就是在太陽的時候撐傘。是非常少見的狀況，可是這在台灣就很平常。特別在台北是很普遍的狀況。現在住在南部的話，就我在南部的經驗的話，其實少蠻多的。不過還是有就對了。在澳洲，我有注意到大家非常熱愛曬太陽，可是相對的，在台灣就沒有這麼熱愛曬太陽。那我自己的話，我是覺得如果是舒服，剛剛好的天氣，溫暖的天氣，我也喜歡曬太陽。可是在澳洲就是說，大家只要天氣好，大家都會跑出來，在公園都會看到一堆人躺在草地上曬太陽，或是在海邊也是。然後比起來的話，台灣人就是會比較認真防曬。可是也不一定啦。\n06:32\n那第二個的話其實就是戴口罩。必須要說現在戴口罩可能很普遍嘛，因為有這個疫情的關係。可是那個時候還沒有疫情啊，所以你在澳洲幾乎不會看到有人戴口罩。我好像沒有看過或是非常少，在台灣就算沒有疫情，還是會看到很多人戴口罩，因為我們戴口罩有蠻多原因的，第一個可能是因為自己感冒了，有點不舒服就會戴口罩，就是不想要傳染給別人，或是自己咳嗽的時候會不好意思。也有可能是過敏。有些人因為季節的變化的關係，會一直打噴嚏，他們也可能會因此戴口罩。不然就是有時候空氣不好也會戴。還有可能就是因為很冷，像是很多人會騎車，騎摩托車。然後風很大就會戴口罩，比較溫暖。所以有各種原因，就算不是疫情，也是非常正常的事情。\n可是在澳洲或是在國外的話，如果戴口罩，大家應該會嚇到，我是說在疫情之前，可能會覺得你發生了什麼事情。因為我平常也沒有特別愛戴口罩，我也很少，幾乎沒有感冒。所以我也沒有特別想說要戴口罩，但是在冬天的時候，因為墨爾本的冬天算是還蠻冷的，然後那個時候我會騎腳踏車，所以風超大。我都是一騎就狂流鼻水，一直流鼻水。所以那個時候我就覺得啊，我應該要戴口罩。\n08:20\n再來還有一點，這個可能不是在台灣很正常，在澳洲很奇怪。但是這一點我覺得蠻可以跟大家分享的。就是在澳洲，因為每一個州的規定可能不一樣啦，那我是以在墨爾本，在Victoria這一州的經驗。我覺得在澳洲對酒的規定算是蠻嚴格的，怎麼說呢？因為第一個就是，在外 在戶外 公共場合，例如說在街上 公園，法律是規定不可以喝酒的。但是在台灣就沒有這個規定，所以在街上或是在哪裡喝酒都沒有關係。其實我在台灣很少喝酒，不常，可是在澳洲就還蠻常的。我覺得澳洲人感覺有特別愛喝酒。特別是說我在那邊又是屬於外國人，然後常常會去社交，認識新朋友，認識新朋友很容易就是說，我們去喝酒，我們去喝一杯。可是在台灣我就還好，沒有特別喜歡喝酒，就是只有跟朋友，還有認識新朋友的時候才會喝一下。\n09:41\n還有一個很不一樣的地方就是說在台灣，你在便利商店還是超市都可以買到酒，很容易就可以買到酒。可是在澳洲的話，他們的便利商店裡面是沒有酒的，他們是有特別的一個商店賣酒。這個我覺得很不一樣，那個時候去有覺得蠻妙的。因為像如果在台灣想喝酒的話，我就去便利商店買酒，還可以買零食什麼，全部都一起買。在澳洲你要買酒的話，你就要去特別一個商店。我在澳洲要買酒的時候都會被店員問我的ID，他們要看我有沒有滿18歲。那這個可能是每家店有點不一樣，有些店可能不管你多老 看起來幾歲，他都會要看。可是有些就不一定，所以我有些朋友他們說，我從來都沒有被問過要看ID啊，為什麼你都被問，之類的。他們可能會覺得亞洲人看起來比較年輕，看不出來幾歲。就算在台灣，我可能也會常常被以為年紀蠻小的，可能會被以為是學生，可是不至於會被以為是不到18歲啊，那太誇張。所以這個我覺得還蠻妙的。\n10:59\n因為我的ID就是我的護照，可是我不可能隨時隨地都帶著我的護照啊。太麻煩了，而且又會怕不見，所以有時候忽然想要買酒就會被拒絕。因為這些店員會被規定說，只要你看起來不到25歲，就一定要看ID。如果他賣給你的話，那他們被抓到是很嚴重的。所以我覺得他們對酒精的規範比較嚴格，那我覺得這樣也是好事啦。\n11:33\n那我還有印象很深刻的一次是，我那個時候在布里斯本(Brisbane)旅行，然後那個時候是復活節。那個時候我跟一些朋友就在城市那邊晃來晃去，那因為是復活節，是連續假日，所以東西都沒有開，很多都沒有開，就空蕩蕩的，然後我們幾個人就在那邊晃來晃去。然後有一位英國朋友，他就很想要喝啤酒。那那一天是星期五，他們叫做Good Friday，那那一天酒吧都是關門的，那天酒吧是不能開的，不能營業的，那天是不能賣酒的。我就覺得很不可思議，特別是那個英國朋友，他就覺得天哪，怎麼會這麼嚴格啊，他好想喝啤酒。然後他就很想喝到甚至去餐廳問可不可以買酒，結果餐廳的人說，你要在這邊用餐，你才可以點酒，但是你不可以單點酒。所以他就覺得很崩潰，因為他又不餓，可是又很想喝酒。所以這個我覺得還蠻妙的，就可以看出說澳洲對酒的規定還蠻嚴格的，跟台灣還蠻不一樣的。\n12:57\n好，這就是我想要跟大家分享的三個我覺得在台灣很正常，可是在澳洲很奇怪的事情。那當然還有很多文化差異，如果你想要聽我分享更多關於台灣跟澳洲的文化差異之類的。歡迎你在我的IG, youtube channel追蹤我，留言告訴我。\n在你的國家跟台灣，有沒有一些生活習慣是你覺得差很多，例如說在你的國家很正常的事情，在台灣很奇怪。或是在台灣很正常的事情，在你的國家很奇怪的一些文化差異，都歡迎你留言告訴我。不一定要在台灣啦，因為可能也不是每個聽眾朋友都來過台灣。你可以講說，在你的國家跟亞洲，或是跟中國 香港，都可以啦，就是可以讓大家去練習一下怎麼去表達這個文化差異。\n13:58\n本週謝謝來自英國的Amy在Apple podcasts給我的五星評論💚\n",
  "Regular Chinese\n\nFirst of all, I would like to start by telling you about an event, which is my podcast program, which is almost a year old. Oh my god. I uploaded the first episode of the show last August 19, 2020, and it's been almost a year since then. It's really unbelievable. A year is not too long, not too short, so I feel quite moved. So I want to do a Q&A, if you have any questions, whether it is about my problems or about Taiwan's problems, you can ask me. Then you can go to my ig my id is talktaiwanesemandarin/podcast. or on my youtube channel. Find this video, and then leave a comment below asking me a question, or you can send me a message directly on my Patreon, or leave a comment below the post of this episode asking me a question, both can.\n\nThen I will record a special episode, especially to answer your questions. So any questions you have for me can ask me while you are here.\n\nThe second small activity is that I want to send postcards. I will probably choose two listeners at random. How do I get this postcard? I'll probably choose the photos I took during my trip to Taiwan and make them into postcards and write them to you by hand. How to get this postcard? You can find the event in the show note program information section, to participate in this event, no matter where you are, no matter you are abroad, or anywhere in the world, I will send it to you. So if you want to get my hand-made, hand-written postcards, then you can go to see how to get the event.\n\n02:40\n\nOkay, let's start today's show. The topic I want to talk to you about today is a topic that a listener told me in my ig that he wanted to hear me talk about, and that is: the daily habits of Taiwan but in Australia it looks very strange. This topic is quite interesting, so I thought about it for a while. If you are newer listeners, you may not know that I previously lived in Melbourne, Australia for over a year in 2018 to early 2020. So today is all about my own experience, that's because I live in Melbourne. Maybe it's a little different from place to place, city to city, state to state. But I'm going to share with you my experience of living in Melbourne.\n\nThe first is to say, in Taiwan actually quite a lot of people, especially girls, quite a lot of people will hold an umbrella, I'm talking about when the weather is good, when the sun will hold an umbrella. Is the sun umbrella, take to cover the sun, so this is a very common thing in Taiwan.\n\n03:54\n\nThere may be many reasons, the first may be do not want to sunburn, or do not want to get skin cancer, or do not want to tan. I'm not afraid of tanning, I think it's not bad. But because my face is very sensitive, my face will become very red when it is exposed to the sun, and I have been seeing a dermatologist before. He advised me not to sunbathe, to protect myself from the sun, to wear a hat or umbrella or something. That's because I don't really like to wear sunscreen on my face. I find it very troublesome and not very comfortable, so I always use physical sunscreen. I wear a hat or an umbrella because my face is not exposed to the sun, but the rest of my body is not as bad.\n\n04:48\n\nWhen I was in Australia, I hardly ever saw anyone wearing an umbrella when the weather was good, only when it rained. But Australia is also really hot in the summer, I was in Melbourne when the hottest to 40 degrees. I was really shocked, I didn't think it would be so hot. Because I think Taiwan is also very hot, but I have never encountered 40 degrees high temperature. Then at that time, I felt so hot, oh my God, I wanted to take an umbrella. But no one was holding an umbrella, I felt embarrassed to do so, and I didn't want to be thought that this person was very strange. So I stayed there for more than a year, I remember only saw twice someone with an umbrella, is in the sun when the umbrella. It's a very rare situation, but it's very common in Taiwan. Especially in Taipei, it's a very common situation. If I live in the south now, my experience in the south is actually quite a bit less. But it's still there, right? In Australia, I have noticed that people love to sunbathe very much, but in contrast, in Taiwan, they don't love sunbathing so much. For myself, I like to sunbathe if it's comfortable, just right, warm weather. But in Australia, as long as the weather is good, everyone will run out, and in the park you will see a lot of people lying on the grass and sunbathing, or at the beach as well. Then, in comparison, Taiwanese people are more serious about sun protection. But it's not necessarily the case.\n\n06:32\n\nThe second one is actually wearing a mask. It must be said that wearing a mask may be very common now, because of the epidemic. But at that time there was no epidemic ah, so you will hardly see people wearing masks in Australia. I don't think I have seen any or very few. In Taiwan, even if there is no epidemic, we still see a lot of people wearing masks because there are quite a lot of reasons why we wear masks. There may also be allergies. Some people sneeze all the time because of the change of seasons, and they may wear a mask for this reason. Or they may wear a mask even if the air is bad sometimes. It could also be because it's cold, like when many people ride bikes or motorcycles. Then it's very windy, so they wear masks, and it's warmer. So there are various reasons, even if it's not an epidemic, it's still very normal.\n\nBut in Australia or abroad, if you wear a mask, people should be shocked, I mean before the epidemic, they might think something has happened to you. I don't usually wear a mask, and I rarely, if ever, get a cold. So I don't particularly want to say I need to wear a mask, but in the winter, because it's quite cold in Melbourne, and then I ride my bike at that time, so it's very windy. My nose was running like crazy when I was riding, and it kept running. So at that time I think ah, I should wear a mask.\n\n08:20\n\nThen there is one more thing, this may not be very normal in Taiwan, in Australia is very strange. But I think this point can be shared with everyone. It is in Australia, because the rules of each state may not be the same la, that I am in Melbourne, in Victoria, the state's experience. I think the rules of alcohol in Australia is quite strict, how to say it? Because the first is, outside, in the outdoors, public places, for example, in the streets, parks, the law is not allowed to drink. But in Taiwan there is no such rule, so it does not matter if you drink on the street or where you are. In fact, I rarely drink in Taiwan, not often, but in Australia is quite often. I think Australians feel that there is a special love of alcohol. In particular, I am a foreigner there, and then often go to socialize, meet new friends, meet new friends is easy to say, we go to drink, let's go for a drink. But in Taiwan I'm okay, I don't particularly like to drink, it's only with friends, and when you meet new friends will drink a little.\n\n09:41\n\nThere is also a very different place is to say that in Taiwan, you can buy wine in convenience stores or supermarkets, it is easy to buy wine. But in Australia, their convenience stores are not inside the wine, they are a special store selling wine. This I feel very different, at that time to go there feel quite wonderful. Because if I want to drink in Taiwan, I will go to the convenience store to buy wine, but also can buy snacks what, all together to buy. In Australia, if you want to buy wine, you have to go to a special store. I want to buy wine in Australia will be asked by the shopkeeper my ID, they have to see if I have over 18 years old. This may be a little different from store to store, some stores may not care how old you are, how old you look, he will have to look. But some are not necessarily, so some of my friends they say, I have never been asked to see ID ah, why are you asked, and so on. They may feel that Asians look younger and can't tell how old they are. Even in Taiwan, I may often be quite young, may be taken as a student, but not as much as will be taken as less than 18 years old ah, that is too exaggerated. So this I think is quite good.\n\n10:59\n\nBecause my ID is my passport, but I can not be anywhere at any time with my passport ah. It's too much trouble, and I'm afraid I'll lose it, so sometimes I suddenly want to buy wine and I'll be denied. If he sells it to you, it's a very serious matter if they get caught. So I think they are more stringent on alcohol regulations, then I think this is also a good thing la.\n\n11:33\n\nAnother time I remember very well was when I was traveling in Brisbane and it was Easter. It was Easter, a continuous holiday, so things were not open, a lot of them were not open, it was empty, and then a few of us were wandering around that side. Then there was a British friend who wanted to drink beer. That day was Friday, they called it Good Friday, that day the bar was closed, that day the bar was not open, not open, that day was not allowed to sell alcohol. I thought it was unbelievable, especially my British friend, he thought, 'Oh my God, how could it be so strict, he wanted to drink beer. Then he wanted to drink so much that he even went to the restaurant and asked if he could buy wine, but the restaurant staff said, 'You have to eat here before you can order wine, but you can't order wine alone. So he felt very broken, because he was not hungry, but also very want to drink. So this I think is quite wonderful, you can see that Australia's rules on alcohol is still quite strict, and Taiwan is quite different.\n\n12:57\n\nWell, this is what I want to share with you three things that I think are normal in Taiwan, but very strange in Australia. Then of course there are many cultural differences, if you want to hear me share more about the cultural differences between Taiwan and Australia and so on. You are welcome to follow me on my IG, youtube channel and leave me a comment to let me know.\n\nAre there any habits in your country and Taiwan that you feel are much different, for example, things that are normal in your country are strange in Taiwan. Or if there are some cultural differences that are normal in Taiwan but strange in your country, you are welcome to leave a comment and let me know. It doesn't have to be in Taiwan, because not every listener has been to Taiwan. You can say that in your country and Asia, or with China, Hong Kong, can be la, is to allow everyone to practice how to express this cultural differences.\n\n13:58\n\nThanks to Amy from the UK for my 5 star review on Apple podcasts this week 💚",
  "Regular Chinese\n\nFirst of all.\n\nAt the beginning I want to tell you about an event.\n\nThat is my podcast program.\n\nThis program is almost a year old.\n\nOh my god.\n\nI started last August 19, 2020.\n\nI uploaded the first episode of the show.\n\nAnd now it's almost a year old.\n\nIt's really unbelievable.\n\nA year is a long time.\n\nShort is not short.\n\nLet me feel wow quite emotional.\n\nSo I want to do a Q & A.\n\nIf you have any questions.\n\nWhether it's about me or about Taiwan.\n\nYou can ask me.\n\nThen you can go to my ig my id is talktaiwanesemandarin.podcast.\n\nOr on my youtube channel.\n\nFind this video.\n\nthen leave a comment below asking me a question.\n\nOr you can send me a direct message on my Patreon.\n\nOr you can send me a direct message on my Patreon, or leave a question below the post of this episode.\n\nYou can do both.\n\nThen I will record a special episode to answer your questions.\n\nI will record a special episode to answer your questions.\n\nSo any questions you have for me can ask me while you are here.\n\nAnd the second little activity.\n\nI want to send postcards.\n\nI will probably choose two listeners at random.\n\nHow do I get this postcard? I made the postcard.\n\nI haven't done it yet.\n\nBut I'll do it when this event starts.\n\nI'll probably choose a picture I took during my trip to Taiwan and make it into a postcard.\n\nThen I will make it into a postcard.\n\nI'll write the postcard to you by hand.\n\nHow to get this postcard? You can find out how to get it in the show note program information section.\n\nto participate in this activity.\n\nNo matter where you are.\n\nNo matter where you are, no matter if you are abroad.\n\nor anywhere in the world.\n\nI'll send it to you.\n\nSo if you want to get a hand-made, hand-written postcard from me\n\nhandwritten postcards, then\n\nSo if you want to get my hand-made, hand-written postcards, you can go to see how to get the activity Oh.\n\n02:40\n\nI'm not sure how to get it.\n\nSo let's get started with today's show.\n\nThe topic I want to talk to you about today is\n\nThis is the topic that one of my listeners told me in my ig that he wanted to hear me talk about.\n\nIt's about the daily habits in Taiwan, but it's very strange to see in Australia.\n\nThis topic is quite interesting.\n\nSo I thought about it for a while.\n\nIf you are relatively new listeners may not know that\n\nI previously lived in Melbourne, Australia in 2018 to early 2020.\n\nI have lived in Melbourne, Australia for more than a year.\n\nSo today is all about my own experience.\n\nThat's because I lived in Melbourne.\n\nMaybe every place.\n\nEach city.\n\nEach state is a little different, I guess.\n\nBut I'm going to share with you my experience of living in Melbourne.\n\nThe first one is to say that\n\nIn Taiwan, there are actually quite a lot of people\n\nEspecially girls.\n\nThere are quite a lot of people who will take umbrellas.\n\nI'm talking about when the weather is good.\n\nI'm talking about when the weather is good, when the sun will hold an umbrella.\n\nIt is a sun umbrella.\n\nto shade the sun.\n\nSo this is a very common thing in Taiwan.\n\n03:54\n\nThere may be many reasons.\n\nThe first may be that you don't want to get sunburn.\n\nThe first is that you don't want to get skin cancer, or you don't want to get a tan.\n\nThe first reason is that you don't want to get sunburn, or don't want to get skin cancer, or don't want to get a tan.\n\nI'm actually going to take an umbrella myself.\n\nI am not afraid of tanning.\n\nI think it's not bad.\n\nBut because my face is very sensitive.\n\nMy face becomes very red when it is exposed to the sun.\n\nThen I have been seeing a dermatologist before.\n\nHe advised me not to sunbathe and to protect my face from the sun.\n\nI need to protect myself from the sun.\n\nWear a hat or umbrella or something.\n\nI don't like to wear sunscreen on my face.\n\nI find it troublesome and not very comfortable.\n\nSo I use a physical sunscreen.\n\nWhat is a physical sunscreen? I wear a hat or an umbrella.\n\nThat's because I can't get sun on my face.\n\nThe other parts of the body are not as bad.\n\n04:48\n\nWhen I was in Australia.\n\nI hardly ever saw anyone with an umbrella when the weather was good.\n\nIt is only when it rains that you will take an umbrella.\n\nBut Australia is also really hot in the summer.\n\nI was in Melbourne when the hottest to 40 degrees.\n\nI was really shocked.\n\nI did not expect it to be so hot.\n\nBecause I think Taiwan is also very hot.\n\nBut I have never encountered 40 degrees.\n\nThen at that time, I felt so hot.\n\nI just felt so hot.\n\nOh my God.\n\nI wanted to take an umbrella.\n\nBut no one was holding an umbrella.\n\nI felt embarrassed to do so.\n\nI don't want to be thought of as a strange person.\n\nSo I've been there for over a year.\n\nI only remember seeing someone holding an umbrella twice.\n\nIt is in the sun when the umbrella.\n\nIt is a very rare situation.\n\nBut this is very common in Taiwan.\n\nEspecially in Taipei, it's a very common situation.\n\nIf you live in the south now\n\nFrom my experience in the south\n\nIn fact, there are quite a few.\n\nBut there are still right.\n\nIn Australia\n\nI have noticed that people love the sun.\n\nHowever, in contrast\n\nIn Taiwan, there is not so much love for sunbathing.\n\nFor myself, I think\n\nI think that if the weather is comfortable, \njust right.\n\nWarm weather.\n\nI also like to sunbathe.\n\nBut in Australia, it is said that\n\nWhenever the weather is good\n\nWhenever the weather is nice, everyone will come out.\n\nI see a lot of people lying on the grass in the park, sunbathing.\n\nOr at the beach too.\n\nThen, in comparison, the\n\nTaiwan people are more serious about sun protection.\n\nBut it is not necessarily so.\n\n06:32\n\nThe second one is actually wearing a mask.\n\nIt is important to say that wearing a mask may be very common nowadays.\n\nBecause there is this epidemic relationship.\n\nBut there was no epidemic at that time.\n\nSo you will hardly see anyone wearing a mask in Australia.\n\nI don't think I've seen any or very few.\n\nIn Taiwan, even if there was no epidemic.\n\nEven if there was no epidemic in Taiwan, you would still see a lot of people wearing masks.\n\nThere are many reasons why we wear masks.\n\nThe first is probably because they have a cold.\n\nThe first reason is that we have a cold and we wear a mask when we are not feeling well.\n\nI don't want to spread the infection to others.\n\nOr you may be embarrassed when you cough.\n\nThere may also be allergies.\n\nSome people have allergies because of the change of seasons.\n\nThey sneeze all the time.\n\nThey may also wear a mask for this reason.\n\nOr they may wear them even if the air is bad sometimes.\n\nIt could also be because it's cold.\n\nFor example, many people will ride bicycles.\n\nRiding motorcycles.\n\nThen the wind is very strong will wear a mask.\n\nWarmer.\n\nSo there are various reasons.\n\nEven if it's not an epidemic.\n\nEven if it is not an epidemic, it is very normal.\n\nBut in Australia or abroad, if you wear a mask\n\nIf you wear a mask\n\npeople should be scared.\n\nI mean, before the epidemic.\n\nI mean, before the epidemic, you might think that something has happened to you.\n\nBecause I don't usually wear a mask.\n\nI rarely.\n\nI hardly ever catch a cold.\n\nSo I didn't particularly want to say that I should wear a mask, either.\n\nBut in the wintertime.\n\nBecause it's pretty cold in Melbourne in the winter.\n\nAnd then I ride my bike at that time.\n\nSo it's very windy.\n\nMy nose would run like crazy when I rode.\n\nMy nose was running all the time.\n\nSo at that time I thought, ah, I should wear a mask.\n\nI should wear a mask.\n\n08:20\n\nAnd then there is one more thing.\n\nThis may not be very normal in Taiwan, in Australia is very strange.\n\nBut this point I think quite can share with you.\n\nIs in Australia.\n\nBecause the rules of each state may not be the same la.\n\nThat I am in Melbourne.\n\nIn Victoria, the state's experience.\n\nI think the rules on alcohol in Australia is quite strict.\n\nHow do I put it? Because the first one is that\n\nThe first is that outside, in public, in public places.\n\nFor example, in the street, in the park.\n\nThe law does not allow drinking.\n\nBut in Taiwan, there is no such rule.\n\nSo it does not matter if you drink on the street or where you are.\n\nIn fact, I rarely drink in Taiwan.\n\nNot often.\n\nBut in Australia, it is quite often.\n\nI think Australians feel a special love of alcohol.\n\nEspecially since I am a foreigner over there.\n\nAnd then I often go to socialize and meet new people.\n\nI think it's easy to meet new people.\n\nIt's easy to meet new people by saying.\n\nLet's go for a drink.\n\nLet's go for a drink.\n\nBut in Taiwan I was fine.\n\nI don't particularly like to drink.\n\nIt's only with friends.\n\nAnd to meet new friends will only drink a little.\n\n09:41\n\nThere is also a very different place is to say that in Taiwan.\n\nYou can buy wine in convenience stores or supermarkets.\n\nIt is very easy to buy wine.\n\nBut in Australia, the words\n\nTheir convenience stores are not inside the wine.\n\nThey are a special store selling wine.\n\nI think this is very different.\n\nThat time to go there feel quite wonderful.\n\nBecause if I want to drink in Taiwan.\n\nI would go to the convenience store to buy wine.\n\nYou can also buy snacks or something.\n\nAll together.\n\nIn Australia, if you want to buy alcohol, you have to go to a special store.\n\nYou have to go to a special store.\n\nWhen I want to buy alcohol in Australia, the shopkeeper will ask me my ID.\n\nThey want to see if I am over 18 years old.\n\nThis may be a little different from store to store.\n\nSome stores may not care how old you are or how old you look.\n\nHe will have to see.\n\nBut some are not necessarily.\n\nSo some of my friends they say that\n\nI've never been asked to see ID ah.\n\nWhy are you being asked?\n\nThey may think that Asian people look better than Asian people.\n\nThey may think that Asians look younger and\n\nI can't tell how old they are.\n\nEven in Taiwan.\n\nI may be often thought of as quite young.\n\nI might be thought of as a student.\n\nBut not so much as to be thought of as less than 18 years old, ah.\n\nThat is too exaggerated.\n\nSo this I think is still quite good.\n\n10:59\n\nBecause my ID is my passport.\n\nBut I can't carry my passport with me anywhere and anytime.\n\nToo much trouble.\n\nAnd will be afraid of losing it.\n\nSo sometimes suddenly want to buy wine will be refused.\n\nBecause these stores are required to say that\n\nAs long as you look under 25 years old.\n\nYou have to see the ID.\n\nIf he sells it to you.\n\nThat they are caught is very serious.\n\nSo I think they are more stringent on alcohol regulations.\n\nThen I think this is also a good thing la.\n\n11:33\n\nThe other time I remember very well was.\n\nI was traveling in Brisbane at the time.\n\nAnd it was Easter at that time.\n\nThat time I was hanging around with some friends in that part of town.\n\nIt was Easter.\n\nIt was a continuous holiday.\n\nSo things weren't open.\n\nA lot of it was not open.\n\nIt was empty.\n\nSo we were just hanging around there.\n\nThen there was a friend from England.\n\nHe wanted to drink beer.\n\nIt was a Friday.\n\nThey called it Good Friday.\n\nThe bars were closed that day.\n\nThe bar was closed that day.\n\nThey couldn't open.\n\nThat day is not allowed to sell alcohol.\n\nI think it's incredible.\n\nEspecially the British friend.\n\nHe was like, 'Oh my God!\n\nHow could it be so strict?\n\nHe wanted to drink beer so badly.\n\nThen he wanted to drink so much that he went to the restaurant and asked if he could buy alcohol.\n\nAnd the guy at the restaurant said\n\n'You have to eat here.\n\nYou can only order wine if you eat here.\n\nBut you can't order wine alone.\n\nSo he felt very broken.\n\nBecause he is not hungry, and\n\nBut also very want to drink.\n\nSo I think this is quite good.\n\nIt can be seen that Australia's rules on alcohol is quite strict.\n\nWith Taiwan is still quite different.\n\n12:57\n\nGood.\n\nThis is what I want to share with you three I think in Taiwan is very normal, but in Australia is very strange.\n\nBut in Australia is very strange things.\n\nThen of course there are many cultural differences.\n\nIf you want to hear me share more about the cultural differences between Taiwan and Australia, you are welcome to follow me on my IG, youtube channel.\n\nYou are welcome to follow me on my IG, youtube channel and\n\nLeave a comment and let me know.\n\nIn your country and Taiwan\n\nAre there any living habits that you feel are much different?\n\nFor example, things that are normal in your country are strange in Taiwan.\n\nIn Taiwan is very strange.\n\nOr things that are normal in Taiwan, but strange in Taiwan.\n\nIn your country is very strange some cultural differences.\n\nYou are welcome to leave a message to tell me.\n\nIt doesn't have to be in Taiwan.\n\nBecause maybe not every listener has been to Taiwan.\n\nYou can talk about it.\n\nIn your country with Asia.\n\nor with China, Hong Kong.\n\nIt's all right.\n\nIt is to allow everyone to practice how to express this cultural difference.\n\n13:58\n\nThanks to Amy from the UK for my 5 star review on Apple podcasts this week 💚 ",
